  "work.description1": "In the introductory Front-End Development course, our culminating project involved crafting a responsive website, utilizing a design layout sourced from Figma.<br/> Throughout the course, I gained a solid understanding of technologies like HTML and CSS, which I put into practice for this final assignment.<br/> You can view my completed project <a href='https://mast3rp1ece.github.io/cursor-ed-homework/FinalHomework/index.html' target='_blank'>here</a>",
  "work.description2": "In the advanced course, I delved into more sophisticated development technologies.<br/> For our concluding project, I designed a portfolio website where I applied the advanced technologies I had learned. The website is constructed using React.js and comprises multiple pages, with navigation facilitated by React Router. I harnessed the power of Redux to enable seamless theme switching between dark and light modes.<br/>The site is fully responsive, featuring a hamburger menu for smaller screens.<br/> Additionally, I incorporated the Â«react-i18nextÂ» library, allowing users to effortlessly switch between languages on the site.<br/> Furthermore, I incorporated various animations throughout the site to enhance the user experience.<br/>",
  "work.description3": "This is my first commercial project. During its development, I had to learn a lot of new things, which is why it took me over three months to  omplete. However, now I could finish it in less than a month. While working on this project, I familiarized myself with backend development, database management (using MySQL), and deploying the project on hosting (DigitalOcean). The project is a portfolio website for a small business specializing in decorating wooden churches. The most interesting part of the project was working on the admin functionality. The admin can add new churches, edit existing ones, set the order of images/videos during  ddition or editing, arrange the churches themselves, and input names and descriptions in three languages. I implemented file storage in two ways: uploading files to an server. Overall, it's an adaptive React/Node.js SPA that I will be able to share soon.",
  "work.description4": "In this company, I work on various projects, focusing on the front-end. I have learned to collaborate effectively in a team, discuss and solve different issues together, and deliver high-quality results for assigned tasks.",
